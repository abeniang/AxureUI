# AxureUI
A prototype UI design for a map of handicap accessible areas around RIT campus.

Installation:
* Extract the “RIT Compass Simulation” Zipped File
* Open the “login” html file to get started
   * The first page will take you to a login page. For student login, username is “Student” and password is “Student”.
   * For admin login, username is “Admin” and password is “Admin”


Known issues:
* The maps may not fill the entire screen of the system, depending on the monitor’s resolution, but the intention is for it to be full screen
* The settings button has no functionality and is placeholder.
* If the filter for Elevators is deselected then selected again, it will show the location that is ment to be added using the add location button. 
This results in the add location button to appear to have no effect on the since the location is already on screen.
* Many features of the prototype are placeholder or have specific outcomes such as add location button creates one predetermined location and 
most inputted text is not recorded due to no actual database, only a visual representation of functionality.
* When zoomed in the locations do not line up with the clickable building pins

I was focused on creating the main home page for student users which includes the multiple different map and satellite
views, the filtering of shown locations, profile information menu, logging out of a student user to show the base functionality
of the site when not logged in, and the creation of the base menu bar which shows and hide all of the options a user has 
based on the type of user.
